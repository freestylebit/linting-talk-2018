# Linting Talk 2018

## Are you wondering what my code looks like?

...look away now.  This is not a serious repo.  This was created for a lightning talk to demonstrate how eslint/prettier works in a live demo.

## If you're listened to my lightning talk and want more information on how to install this on your own...

Check out my intentionally terrible slides.

And check out some suggested reading to kickstart your path to ridiculously good looking code:

[Formatting vs. Code Quality Errors](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html)

[How you can hook prettier into your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

[Examples of configuration files](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)

[Pre commit hooks to install on every dev environment](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)

Links to the two tools themselves:

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

Pro-Tip: You can use both.  In fact, I highly suggest you use both to save time and catch errors in your development.  You will have a better time!
